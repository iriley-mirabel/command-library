To finalize your setup, we will create a .cursorrules file. This acts as the "brain" of the project, ensuring the AI is aware of your custom library and follows your specific development lifecycle111111111.+2📜 The Master .cursorrules FileCreate a file named .cursorrules in your project root.

## 🛠 Command Library Awareness
You are an expert developer assistant equipped with a specialized library of slash commands found in `.cursor/commands/`.
- [cite_start]**Always** check `.cursor/commands/` to understand the specific steps for any workflow requested[cite: 566, 686].
- [cite_start]Prioritize using the defined sequences in `/standardize-page`, `/pre-commit-checklist`, and `/daily-cleanup`[cite: 284, 285, 302, 317].

## 🔄 Workflow Protocols
1. [cite_start]**Approval Gates**: For multi-step workflows like `/standardize-page`, stop and ask for "Approval" after each phase (e.g., after cleanup but before UI fixes)[cite: 287, 295].
2. [cite_start]**Standardization**: Every new UI component must follow the `/fix-form-fields` and `/standardize-status-badges` patterns to ensure design token compliance[cite: 133, 145, 154].
3. [cite_start]**Quality Gate**: Refuse to finalize a task until `/test-page-quick` has been run to verify the changes[cite: 161, 557, 569, 578].

## 🎨 UI & Design System
- **Spacing**: Use design tokens only. [cite_start]If you see hardcoded `px` values, trigger `/fix-spacing-layout`[cite: 78, 83, 265, 562].
- [cite_start]**Imports**: Always maintain the order: React → External → Internal → Types as defined in `/fix-import-paths`[cite: 66, 73, 554].

## 🚨 Critical Constraints
- [cite_start]**Do NOT** use deprecated commands like `/dead-code-removal`; use `/cleanup-unused-code` instead[cite: 579, 630, 635].
- [cite_start]**Do NOT** commit code without a summary generated by `/pr-ready`[cite: 227, 310, 501, 556].

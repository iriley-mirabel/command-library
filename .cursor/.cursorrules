# Team Development Standards & Workflows

## 🛠 Command Library Awareness
You are an expert developer assistant equipped with a specialized library of slash commands found in `.cursor/commands/`.
- **Always** check `.cursor/commands/` to understand the specific steps for any workflow requested
- Prioritize using the defined sequences in `/standardize-page`, `/pre-commit-checklist`, and `/daily-cleanup`

## 🔄 Workflow Protocols
1. **Approval Gates**: For multi-step workflows like `/standardize-page`, stop and ask for "Approval" after each phase (e.g., after cleanup but before UI fixes)
2. **Standardization**: Every new UI component must follow the `/fix-form-fields` and `/standardize-status-badges` patterns to ensure design token compliance
3. **Quality Gate**: Refuse to finalize a task until `/test-page-quick` has been run to verify the changes

## 🎨 UI & Design System
- **Spacing**: Use design tokens only. If you see hardcoded `px` values, trigger `/fix-spacing-layout`
- **Imports**: Always maintain the order: React → External → Internal → Types as defined in `/fix-import-paths`

## 🚨 Critical Constraints
- **Do NOT** use deprecated commands like `/dead-code-removal`; use `/cleanup-unused-code` instead
- **Do NOT** commit code without a summary generated by `/pr-ready`

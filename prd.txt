PRD: Cursor Command Library & Workflow Hub
1. Project Overview
A web-based portal for development teams to browse, search, and export a standardized library of Cursor IDE slash commands and workflows.

2. Technical Stack (Recommended)
Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI

Content: Markdown-based (to match Cursor's native format)

Deployment: Vercel or GitHub Pages

3. Core Features & App Structure
A. The Sidebar Navigation
Search Bar: Filter commands by name or tag (e.g., "UI", "Cleanup").

Categories: * Getting Started (Installation instructions)

Individual Commands (The atomic tools)

Workflows (The chained commands)

Best Practices (The .cursorrules setup)

B. Command Detail View
Each command page must display:

Title: e.g., /standardize-page

Description: What it does.

Code Block: The actual Markdown content with a "Copy to Clipboard" button.

Usage Badge: (e.g., "Fast", "5-10 mins", "High Impact").

C. The "Export for Project" Tool
A button to "Download .cursor/commands Config".

This triggers a download of a .zip file containing all the .md files we've created, pre-structured in a .cursor/commands/ directory.

4. Content to Seed (The Command Library)
File: /standardize-page.md
Markdown

# /standardize-page
Standardize page layout, imports, and UI components.
Steps: 1. Fix Imports | 2. Cleanup | 3. Design Tokens | 4. UI Components.
File: /pr-ready.md
Markdown

# /pr-ready
Audit code quality, summarize changes, and generate a GitHub-ready PR description.
(AI Note: Use the full library of 75+ commands from the provided Master Reference to populate the database/registry).

5. Repository Structure
The generated GitHub repo should look like this:

Plaintext

├── app/                # Next.js web application
├── public/             # Assets and downloadable .zip templates
├── library/            # Master .md files for the commands
│   ├── cleanup.md
│   ├── imports.md
│   └── ... (all 75+ commands)
├── README.md           # Instructions for the dev team
└── .cursor/            # The app's own Cursor config
6. Prompt for Cursor to Build the App
Copy and paste this into Cursor Composer:

"I want to build a Next.js application using Tailwind and Shadcn UI. This app is a 'Command Registry' for my dev team.

Create a searchable dashboard that displays a list of 'Slash Commands'.

When a command is clicked, show its Markdown content with a 'Copy' button.

Include a 'Download All' button that bundles a folder named .cursor/commands containing all the .md files.

Use a clean, developer-focused 'Dark Mode' aesthetic.

Create a 'Quick Start' page explaining how to move the downloaded files into a project root.

Base the content of the commands on the 'Master Reference' logic provided in our chat history."

PROMPT: Build the "Cursor Command Central" Portal
Instructions for Cursor: Create a Next.js (App Router) application with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. This app will act as a documentation hub and distribution tool for our team's custom Cursor slash commands.

1. App Architecture & Pages
Home (/): A high-level dashboard showing the "Most Used" commands and a search bar that filters the library.

Library (/library): A grid/list view of all 75+ commands.

Command Detail (/command/[id]): A dedicated page for each command showing description, use cases, and a "Copy Markdown" button.

Install (/install): A guide on how to clone the repo or manually add the .cursor/commands folder to a project.

2. Key Component: The "Project Bundler"
Create a utility that allows users to click a button and download a .zip file.

Structure of ZIP: It must contain a folder named .cursor with a subfolder commands.

Contents: Every command in the library must be saved as an individual .md file inside that folder.

3. The Content Source (Machine-Ready Commands)
Use the following content to generate the individual .md files for the repository and the app database:

Category: Core Workflows
File: standardize-page.md

Markdown

# /standardize-page
Standardize page layout, imports, and UI components.
1. Run /fix-import-paths
2. Run /cleanup-unused-code
3. Convert hardcoded px to design tokens
4. Standardize UI components (Filter, Table, Forms)
5. Run /test-page-quick
File: pre-commit-checklist.md

Markdown

# /pre-commit-checklist
Complete quality check before PR.
1. Audit for logs/dead code.
2. Verify design token compliance.
3. Run quick smoke tests on critical routes.
4. Generate /pr-ready summary.
Category: UI Components
File: fix-filter-bar.md

Markdown

# /fix-filter-bar
Standardize filter bar layout. Ensure "All" option exists, fix spacing, and verify view-mode toggle logic.
File: fix-data-table.md

Markdown

# /fix-data-table
Fix column definitions, status badge styling, and cell spacing. Remove legacy table properties.
Category: Utility & Discovery
File: find-command.md

Markdown

# /find-command [keyword]
Search the team library for specific tools based on keywords (e.g., "forms", "api", "clean").
4. Design Language
Theme: Dark mode by default (Slate/Zinc).

Typography: Monospace for command names; Sans-serif for descriptions.

Interactive: "Copy to Clipboard" buttons on every code block.


Developer Setup Guide (To include in the App's README)
How to share this with your team:

GitHub Repo: Initialize a repo and paste the code Cursor generates.

The .cursor/ folder: Commit the .cursor/commands folder directly to your project repos so they are "plug-and-play."

The Website: Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel so non-technical stakeholders or new devs can browse the library easily.

Cursor, please begin by scaffolding the Next.js project and creating the commands.json data structure using the descriptions provided above.

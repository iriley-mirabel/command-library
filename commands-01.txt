The "Daily Routine" Core Commands
These are the small, fast tools your team will use every hour.

File: .cursor/commands/cleanup.md

Markdown

# /cleanup-unused-code
Remove unused imports, commented-out code, unused variables, and console logs. Standardize the file structure after cleaning.
File: .cursor/commands/imports.md

Markdown

# /fix-import-paths
Fix broken import paths and standardize the order: React first, then external libraries, then internal components, and types last. Convert relative paths to absolute `@/` paths.
File: .cursor/commands/test.md

Markdown

# /test-page-quick
Perform a rapid smoke test of the current page. Identify rendering errors, broken API calls, or console errors. Verify critical paths like Dashboard, Products, and Customers.
2. UI Component Standardization
Use these when building or fixing specific parts of the UI.

File: .cursor/commands/filter-bar.md

Markdown

# /fix-filter-bar
Standardize the filter bar. Ensure an "All" option exists, fix spacing using design tokens, and ensure view-mode switching logic is functional.
File: .cursor/commands/data-table.md

Markdown

# /fix-data-table
Standardize data table implementation. Fix column definitions, cell spacing, and status badge components. Remove legacy properties.
File: .cursor/commands/forms.md

Markdown

# /fix-form-fields
Replace plain HTML labels with the project's `Label` component. Standardize placeholders, add validation logic, and fix field spacing using design tokens.
3. Workflow Chains (The "Power" Commands)
These files tell Cursor to run multiple steps in a specific order.

File: .cursor/commands/standardize.md

Markdown

# /standardize-page
Perform a full page standardization. 
1. Run /fix-import-paths.
2. Run /cleanup-unused-code.
3. Fix layout spacing and convert px to design tokens.
4. Standardize UI components (Filters, Tables, Forms).
5. Run /test-page-quick to verify.
Wait for approval after each step.
File: .cursor/commands/pr.md

Markdown

# /pr-ready
Prepare the code for a Pull Request.
1. Perform a final quality audit for logs and unused code.
2. Summarize the changes made.
3. Generate a Markdown PR description including a "Changes" list and "Commands Run" section.
4. Confirm /test-page-quick was successful.
4. Discovery & Help
Help your team find the right command without checking a PDF.

File: .cursor/commands/find.md

Markdown

# /find-command
Search the command library. 
- Categories: UI, Testing, Cleanup, Workflow.

# 📚 Team Command Library
To use these commands, type `/` followed by the command name in the Cursor Composer (Cmd+I) or Chat (Cmd+L).

| Command | Purpose | Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/cleanup-unused-code` | Clean dead code/logs | 1-2m |
| `/fix-import-paths` | Fix & sort imports | 1m |
| `/standardize-page` | Full page refactor | 5-10m |
| `/test-page-quick` | Smoke test | 2m |
| `/pr-ready` | Generate PR description | 2m |

**Rules:** - Always use `@Codebase` when running workflows.
- Do not bypass the `/test-page-quick` step before pushing.
Next Steps:
Create the .cursor/commands/ folder.

Create each .md file listed above.

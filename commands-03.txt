While the text you provided is a comprehensive reference, it serves more as a human-readable manual than a machine-executable command library.

To make these commands work inside Cursor’s AI (specifically in the Composer or Chat), you need to break them into individual .md files within the .cursor/commands/ directory.

I have converted the most critical parts of your reference into the Cursor-native format. You should create these files in your project root to activate them.

1. The "Controller" Workflow
This file chains your existing commands together. It allows the AI to understand the sequence of operations for your complex workflows.

File: .cursor/commands/standardize-page.md

Markdown

# /standardize-page
Standardize a page by running all common fixes and quality checks.

## 📋 Execution Steps
Please execute these commands in order. **Stop and ask for feedback after Step 4.**

1. **Imports**: Run `/fix-import-paths` to standardize order and fix broken paths.
2. **Cleanup**: Run `/cleanup-unused-code` to remove dead code and logs.
3. **Layout**: Run `/fix-spacing-layout` to convert hardcoded px to design tokens.
4. **UI Components**: Run `/fix-filter-bar`, `/implement-view-modes`, and `/fix-data-table`.
5. **Forms**: If forms exist, run `/fix-form-fields`.
6. **Verification**: End with `/test-page-quick`.

## 🛠️ Context
- **Target Path**: @[path]
- [cite_start]**Time Estimate**: 5-10 minutes [cite: 300]
2. Individual Command Library
Create individual files for your most-used granular commands so they appear in the / dropdown menu.

File: .cursor/commands/cleanup.md

Markdown

# /cleanup-unused-code
[cite_start]**Purpose:** Remove unused imports, commented code, unused variables, and console.logs[cite: 55].

## Instructions
- [cite_start]Remove any code blocks that are commented out[cite: 61].
- [cite_start]Identify and delete unused variables or functions[cite: 62].
- [cite_start]If `--remove-console-logs` is passed, delete all console.log statements[cite: 56, 63].
- Standardize the file after cleaning.
File: .cursor/commands/imports.md

Markdown

# /fix-import-paths
[cite_start]**Purpose:** Fix broken imports and standardize order[cite: 66].

## Instructions
- [cite_start]Convert relative paths to absolute `@/` paths[cite: 72].
- [cite_start]Organize order: React → External → Internal → Types[cite: 73].
- [cite_start]Ensure all imports are used; remove those that aren't[cite: 74].
3. The "Team Todo" Discovery Command
This replaces your "Scenario" sections with an interactive search for your developers.

File: .cursor/commands/find-command.md

Markdown

# /find-command [keyword]
[cite_start]Search the command library to find the right tool for the task[cite: 235].

## Usage Guide
[cite_start]Search by these categories[cite: 240, 241]:
- **"UI"**: `/fix-filter-bar`, `/fix-data-table`, `/fix-form-fields`
- **"Testing"**: `/test-page-quick`, `/debug-failing-page`
- **"Cleanup"**: `/clean`, `/imports`, `/refactor`

## Scenarios
- [cite_start]**First Day?** Run `/test-page-quick`[cite: 495].
- [cite_start]**Before PR?** Run `/pre-commit-checklist`[cite: 504].
- [cite_start]**Fixed a bug?** Run `/daily-cleanup`[cite: 539].
4. Implementation Steps for your Team
Directory Structure: Create a folder named .cursor/commands/ in your repository root.

Add Files: Save the Markdown blocks above as separate .md files in that folder.

Global Rules: Create a file named .cursorrules in your root. Add this line:

"When a user uses a slash command, strictly follow the definitions found in .cursor/commands/."


The Library: Since your reference guide lists 75+ commands, I recommend starting with the Top 10 most used ones as individual files first to avoid overwhelming the AI's context.
